## Snap Manager

Hi, This is my customized app using Tuya Android SDK that used on [Tuya Demo App](https://github.com/TuyaInc/tuyasmart_home_android_sdk).
Why i didn't use the OEM app? because i need heavy customized and very technical integration into my system that is not supported yet by the OEM app. Thats why i choose this decision.
